# üöÄ Create a Windows Virtual Machine using Azure Sandbox (Microsoft Learn)

This guide walks you through the process of creating a Windows virtual machine in Microsoft Azure and connecting to it via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Perfect for beginners looking to gain hands-on experience with Azure cloud services!

## üìö Project Overview

In this project, I followed the **Microsoft Learn** self-paced lab to:

- Sign in and activate the Azure sandbox
- Create a Windows Server Virtual Machine
- Connect to the VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Learn the basics of cloud infrastructure and Azure Portal

This repository includes screenshots and documentation of each step I completed.
